Got a raise in my salary and I feel very miserable,"Today I (28M) got a raise at my job, my salary went from 110k to 130k because of my ""excellent performance"" I have given it all in the past year. I did work on weekends many times and worked after hours without getting paid. I was told to come into the office 2 days but went all 5 days even on weekends.

I decided to do this on my own and wasn't told by my manager to do it. I just did my work.The reason I did all this work non-stop was because I was so alone and miserable and so to distract myself I just kept doing my work. It wasn't good to keep doing the work nonstop but I realized that if I went outside to do the things that I liked, people were quick to judge.

When I did make free time for myself, I went to events to meet other people and find someone in my life and got called ugly and unattractive. I want a long term relationship in my life which people were afraid of and obviously found me unattractive. In addition I was made fun of constantly by friends for being a virgin and tolf that I am missing out.

I dont know how to feel but I feel like im a failure and I've messed up hard in my life.

TLDR: Got a higher raise at my job for my ""hard work"" but im still miserable because im told im not attractive to find a partner.",TRUE
28M - Looking for long-term chat buddies,"Ive got varied interests in loads of different things so I'm happy to talk about anything and everything.

Do you share your problems with anyone?,"I am almost 30 y/o and most of my life I felt I am not as good as other people. I have had problems making friends or forming relationships because of social anxiety. But my feelings are something I never share with my friends or family. Maybe I should talk to a therapist, but they are quite expensive and the few times I tried I felt I don't know what to say. I feel like I just keep living my life uncertain of the future, still living in my parents house and feeling alone wishing I had a gf. But even if I had one I am not sure if things would change, I honestly feel like I lack comunication, of things that happens to me. Do you relate? Or do you have someone to share your problems with? I feel like I keep all things to myself and they become poison inside me. Or that I just go so used to live like that that I do not even try to change, just let time run by. Thank you for reading.

Alone in my room,"It is 2:40 in the morning. I am alone in my room watching a movie while crying about my loneliness and the failure of my life. I'm thinking of killing myself but I don't have the resources for do it the way I would like and I don't want to hurt my family. I'm asking myself when my life turned to shit. Why I feel so powerless. Why I can't just do the things I have to do for improve my life. Why I can't just think about the things that happened in my life without feel remorse and sadness.

Need Advice,"already posted this on r/askmen but I feel that you guys will understand it more

Im a 15 year old boy. I’m 5’9, 57kg, skinny looking, and a baby face. I’ve grown around women, with my father being the sole male figure in my life, and our relationship is quite strained. His personality reminds me of a teenaged boy’s, from his constant need to be masculine to his male centric interests. When I was younger he often called me gay (or sometimes faggot) cuz I was always with girls. I was a really fat child. But during the pandemic, I changed. I became more reserved and quiet, as well as my now skinny physique. I would say that my sister, who is almost 17, is my best friend. She and my mother always defend me from my father. I’m a new student in my school. Even in my old school, I was the quiet kid and the “baby” of the class. Everyone treats me differently, i can’t pinpoint if it’s a good or bad thing. People say that I’m quite mature but also act like a baby. I can say that I’m quite emotionally stunted cause my mom always treats me like her baby, even now. People say that boys are naturally friends with boys and girls with girls but that is not the case for me. Idk why but that bothers me. I had only female friends until now.

I met a couple of guys who live near our 2nd house around 2 years ago but I didn’t really mind them that much. I only approached them now and we became friends. They told me that I need to change cuz Im gonna have a hard time. Every week we hang out, they introduce me to their friends, and teach me some basketball skills cuz i never held played a sport my whole life (its fun tbh). They’re nice guys and unlike me, they actually seem like boys. They’re naughty in a way that a carefree teenaged boy is, something I envy. But as time passes my being different seems to show. One of them often check my heartbeat when I’m around people. I’m quite awkward around their friends. And even though I’m the oldest, I seem like a little baby.

One day, I wore an outfit consisting of a beige knitted sweater, a white polo shirt, black jeans, and aviator style glasses. My sister taught me how to style myself and because of her I have built a unique fashion taste for myself. Here in my country (i dont live in america), boys my age often wear black graphic tees and some simple jeans. Once again, I got called gay. He said it’s because of my outfit, my mannerisms, and my “cute” looking face ( i also don’t know why that is considered a bad thing). I told him my fashion is a way of expressing myself as someone who is very insecure. I got irritated. I’m not gay cuz i really don’t like boys. He said it’s just “real talk”. I said that it’s just bullshit. I told all that and more to my sister. She said everyone was really surprised I became close with him. Tbh he’s a nice guy and has done a lot for improving myself. She said that i dont need to change just for others and that i should love myself. But i said that if i continue to be this way, i don’t think i’ll learn to love myself. I told more to her and she told me more but i wont go deeper. Then she asked her friend for advice and she told me that there is nothing wrong with me. There is nothing wrong with being different. But she also said that if i want to change, let me change as long as there is no harm done. She also told me that being unique is far better than being like them. These kinds of advices are why I stick with girls. But i don’t like myself for being this way; awkward, socially inept, and feminine. And since im straight, ill have a hard time courting. I’m afraid that everyone, girls i like, will continue to view me as a little brother who badly needs help and not treat me like a normal teenaged guy. Most people treat me like a little baby, even those who are younger than me. I honestly seem more like a child than a teen. I need to gain confidence in order to improve myself, have higher grades, hit the gym, play sports, and build relationships, yet i feel that there is this thing holding me back from doing so, that mixed with laziness and procrastination, but most of all shyness and anxiety.

What it's like to be a guy (24m),"So a few days ago I made a post about the time I told my ex gf I got S/A'd as a child and her response was something along the lines of ""don't tell me about this."" Three or four people commented and a couple of them said I could reach out to them if I wanted to talk... It's been three days and all three haven't responded. I didn't do that with the intention of getting attention from anyone. I just felt like I wanted to get it off of my chest because as a man I'll never be able to tell anyone close to me about the situation without them looking at me as lesser. So it's been 20 years since and nobody knows about it. The next day though I thought I'd actually make a post on here to try to talk to some other lonely people or anyone in general really, so I made a more upbeat post about some of my hobbies and how I'm looking for a friend with no response. I wish I just had someone I could talk to regularly. It would mean the entire world to me. I'm at the point in my life where the the longest conversations I have with anyone last only a few minutes. Then I dwell on them for weeks or months after until I get to have a conversation with another person. And these conversations go nowhere, never lead to any friendship. I know I'm the problem. I just wish I knew exactly what it is to fix and how to fix it. I'll probably check this post tomorrow and see 1000 views and zero comments. I wish I were good enough to have friends. I'm getting too old for this. Seeing all the girls on r/lonely complain about how they're getting hundreds of messages and they're all ""bad vibes"" is so painful to see. I don't get a hundred messages over the span of a year if I post on multiple pages frequently... I wish I were good enough.

"Old man in a new world
","41-year-old man, probably going through an existential crisis, again. Feel free to skip if it bores you.

Yesterday I realized that I am officially ancient. I Was speaking to a guy, just for the sake of speaking to him. I like talking to people and did not know he was 21. He asked me how old I was, and I said 41. He said don't you think you are too old to be talking to a 21-year-old? This is the first time this has happened to me. I guess I can only blame myself. I have never felt old. I look good for my age. I take care of myself and very healthy and because I am in the technology field, I work with young people all the time. I guess I never realized I got old. It seems time has creeped up without me realizing.

I am an old school liberal. My parents are full blown conservatives. Pretty much everybody in my life from that generation was. I never felt part of that group and was extremely isolated. My parents and I rarely see eye to eye but there is an agreed upon peace. Basically, don't talk about your stuff and I won't talk about mine. It's fine for peace but that is all. No bridges are ever built no concessions ever made. I guess it is what it is.

When I reached my teens, the internet was just starting to pop off. It started move from uber niche\corporate culture to mainstream. Those were the days. Myspace, IRC, YouTube was still in its infancy. The internet was a harbor to the new world. I remember how exciting everything was, and the potential, limitless.

For a time, it was magical but like everything good in this world eventually it all turns into shit. I detest what it has become. No longer this bastion of ideas and likeminded people but instead this hyper polarized set of ideas and people. Everybody has their corner and don't you dare come with your opinion if it's different. It's always been the case, but not to this extent. It has become progressively worse over time.

I hate social media. Once upon a time it was a nice way to reunite with friends you lost contact with, but it has become this narcissistic cesspool of psychopaths. I detest it and I won't be part of that group. I have a million ways to feel shit about myself I don't need another medium to add to it.

I guess if you got to this point without falling asleep you are probably asking what this old man is rambling about. My point being that I grew up on the internet, never realized I got old. I have ""young"" mindset but not young enough. I am supposed to act my age, but I don't feel 41. Maybe I am an old man trying to cling onto something that I should have let go ages ago as a consequence I feel like I don't belong anywhere, and that ladies and gentlemen is why I feel like the loneliest man on earth.

I know it's nobody's problem except my own but this a forum for lonely people and maybe there is at least one person out there who feels the same.",TRUE
A small town guy's take on the big-city Culture,"So, I'm a 23-year-old dude who recently made the leap from a small town to the a big city. It's been quite the ride, but I've noticed something that's been on my mind.

Here, being 'cool' revolves around sex, drugs, and Instagram followers – a race based on superficial measures. But is that really what defines someone's value? I doubt it. Meaningful conversations are rare, overshadowed by a quest for greed and materialism.

But let me be real – is that really what defines a person's value? I don't think so. I've encountered a sea of faces, yet meaningful conversations have been scarce. It's like everyone's on a quest for greed, showoff, and materialism.

Maybe it's just the city vibe, but it's left me feeling a bit lost and disconnected. Has anyone else experienced this shift in values?

I believe there's more to life than the numbers on your Instagram or the stories you tell about wild nights. True connections, kindness, and authenticity seem to be overlooked in the quest for a 'cool' status.

So, what should I do? How do you navigate this city culture without losing sight of what truly matters? Let's share some thoughts and experiences!",FALSE

It only keeps getting worse,"(sorry for any formatting issues, or if this is the wrong sub, I very rarely use reddit + I'm on my phone)

It's just as the title says, things just keep getting worse and I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I [17F] had a pretty good life. Awesome, loving friends, a job I adored that I could genuinely see a future with, passions and aspirations. I didn't have a boyfriend, but it wasn't on top of my priorities, and there was this really sweet and dorky guy I was talking to. On top of that, I always felt myself to be at least decently attractive. Many of my friends have often told me how attractive I am, and if our relationship was slightly different they'd be begging for a chance with me. It was always silly stuff, but I really appreciated it. Then out of nowhere something happened that I really had nothing to do with, and I had to leave in one day. With absolutely no warning, I had to flee the only life I had ever known with nothing but what I could carry in a duffel bag and relocate far, far away.

It sucked. My life after that sucked. I was sleeping on a couch I shared with 3 other people, I had no friends, nothing to my name. I lost my lust for life. And finally when things started to barely look good again despite the entire situation still being terrible, another disaster struck. A fire destroyed my entire town. I lost people I had met and began to really care about, I lost my most precious sentimental items I had brought from my original home, I lost everything I had started to rebuild my life with.

But now I'm in school again, and it's only getting worse. I am not meant for the environment I am living in. I'm no longer the beauty standard, I think I'm not even looked at. The weather makes me break out horribly and my hair greasy constantly. There's no way around it, I'm getting ugly. I'm homeless, I have terrible and immature friends I can't stand, and I'm so lonely it's driving me insane. I want a partner so badly, I crave gentle companionship instead of constantly being alone or surrounding myself with people that I can't truly connect with (like I could my previous friends, who I love wholeheartedly and miss so bad). I have always considered myself a lover. I want to provide, I want to hold, I want to laugh, I have so much love to give and nowhere to give it because I believe I am irrelevant. My friends from my previous home still compliment me, but I just don't believe them anymore. They're attracted to who I was when they knew me, not who I am now.

My best friend from my previous home [F18] just downloaded Tinder and has gotten handfuls of matches within a few hours. Amongst those men happens to be what might be my dream man. He's gorgeous, but not intimidatingly handsome. We have the same taste in music, the same hobbies, aspirations, beliefs. But I don't live there anymore. My friend does. And she's hitting it off great, and he's receptive to the flirting, and I'm incredibly happy for her because she's my best friend!! But I'm so jealous I don't know what to do with myself, because it just doesn't seem fair. Especially because I look in the mirror and when I put effort into myself I do see someone who is objectively attractive, but I just don't believe it anymore.

I don't know, I'm trying really hard. But it's so difficult to see the bright side of things. I've changed, I've become more girly and put a focus on my looks and how I dress. I've become more agreeable. I try and fail to make new friends. I've lost my goals, my drive, my dreams, anything that used to make me happy. I don't think I'm depressed, I don't feel depressed. Things are just undeniably terrible, constantly. My life has been a downhill struggle for a year now and I've never felt so alone in my life, not even when I was genuinely alone for months when I first got here.

I'm stuck somewhere I hate, where things like teen pregnancy, abuse, drugs, and cheating is all incredibly normalized. Where I am no longer regarded as attractive because I'm not the standard. My life and everything I cared about has been ripped away from me twice in under a year. I feel like the only person IRL anymore who even looks at me with interest is my 60 something Spanish teacher (which is a whole different topic)

Every time I start to stand up life seems to punch me in the face all over again. I can't catch a win and I just don't know what to do with myself. I know this mostly seems like a vent, and I guess it did turn into one for sure, but really I just don't know what to do. I think the tipping point for all this was the fact that I can't get a partner, which wouldn't be a problem if I never had to leave my home. Is there even anything I can do? Or do I just wait in desperate solitude until I can either escape this place I live or get picked up by someone likely older and bad for me? I'm almost receptive to the idea, and that's scary. It just feels hopeless, like it's not even worth looking anymore.

I have 2 friends, but it seems to me like they distance from me.

I used to game every day, till midnight. I gave it up last autumn, I am very happy about being free of those games.

I know what I want to do, but I am too young to do it (15), at the same times it seems like that I have no talent or anything, as all I do, I know the bare basics, but nothing else, and I do not learn anything else as well.

I don't know what to do or where to go. I feel lonely and empty.

We have not the same interests as well, we just had the same humour and from then on, I just sticked to him. But I know, that he is not my future. I know that. I have my best friend, she knows pretty much everything of me and we have been best friends for a very long time. However, we rarely meet, we are in the same class, and still dont spend a lot of time together.

The loneliness is suffocating,"I am person who loves their own company but the loneliness has been extremely suffocating recently. I've gone through two terrible breakups since 2016 and a couple of other traumatic experiences. I've gone through depression and anxiety over the past few years as well. As a result I've stopped socialising much and keeping constant contact with friends. But over the past few months the loneliness has been slowly creeping up on me. I really wish I had some friends with whom I could have deep conversations and keep consistent contact. Will the loneliness ever end?

I mourn for myself,"Sometimes, I mourn for the hopes and dreams I had that I know I could never have. I wish I could live another lifetime, maybe I will get a better chance then.

"With Aspergers and related issues, am I (21M) just destined to never date and find romance?","I don’t know how, I don’t have the confidence to do it, I overthink everything, I have no opportunities, I suck at talking to people I don’t know, especially girls. I have Aspergers and OCD, and likely some sort of social anxiety, so besides one or two few friends and my family I can’t socialize. I hate it and it makes me feel bad but at the same time I want to find someone who I can share my life with. I really don’t know what to do. Part of me just wants to stop worrying about it, but part of me feels like I should try to do something about it. I don’t really know.

It hurts never being chosen.,"It hurts that there's something wrong with me. It hurts that no matter what I do, I'm never in my life going to be someone's first choice. It hurts knowing I'm not as good as anyone else. I just feel like giving up.",TRUE

What's the point anymore?,"Nobody loves or cares about me. I tried putting myself out there only to be used and ignored. People don't know I exist unless they want something.

I call people and they just send me right to voicemail after one or two rings. They treat me like I'm a pain in the ass.

People went insane when COVID appeared. They started talking about being lonely. Yet these same mofos have friends, family, and social media they could reach out to. Lockdown is my life.

I'm just so exhausted.",TRUE

28F - Anyone want to get married?,"Yes, I said married. I'm 28, I'm not bad looking, and I've been in one stupid relationship after another. I'm looking for someone who wants to get married and start a family. I live in South Africa, but I'm happy to immigrate once I finish my degree. That gives as a year and a half before I can get a work visa and come live wherever you are and we get married.

Idk. I'm lonely. This is stupid and basically a joke. Or maybe you're the one... haha. Let's just chat.",TRUE

"Feeling like trash, because I am.","I wake upup, and I already feel terrible. I really want a hughughug, I really want to be with some one, be there for someone. I don't know if it's this weird mix of loneliness, depression, horny, etc, etc, but God I want this to stop. I don't know how. I don't even know how to stop this pain. Get into a relationship, How!? No one would want me anyway. Sleep, just wake up feeling the same. Better yourself, like anything I can do even work, I'm a broken tool, ddesigned for doing a job, but too worn to even achieve their only worth. Get a prostitute, ILLEGAL! I'm filth man.

People don't always get what they deserve in life,"There seems to be a perception that people get what they deserve in life but in reality, this idea is horseshit. I have seen a lot of bad people living prosperous lives and a lot of genuinely good people who never hurt anyone living miserable lives full of unnecessary suffering. The universe doesn't care about fairness. It's really about luck. Being born with good genetics and with advantages.

Think about how many injustices have happened throughout history and which still happen today all over the world. Many bad people never face punishment for their actions. Most of the world's population is poor and only like 1% of people have a huge chunk of the world's wealth.",FALSE

I wanna feel the touch of a woman so bad,"Tw:sh, sewerslide

18M here , well I mainly do not mean sexually , but I just miss the feeling when I had girls like me ,I miss making out with a girl I love , I miss hugging a girl that I have feelings for , I miss having someone to be obsessed with, to text and to smile to her texts , to tell me she loves me or even feeling like I'm even worthy of love .

I broke up with a girl that I wasn't even dating and I have amost never spoken to a girl ever since , and when I did I just kept self sabotaging like ignoring a girl when there's obviously something there , and ignoring even the one female friend that I have (female bestfriend kinda thing) and I just miss my old days , not only that but I live in a complete isolation especially since I just started uni.

I planned to off myself many times , i self harm pretty much on a daily basis , and today I simply broke down in front of my mother crying hysterically for seemingly no reason.

I just want everything to end...",TRUE
