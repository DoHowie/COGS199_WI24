I think Instagram is reading my DMs to show me targeted ads. Anyone else experienced this ?,"So today I was talking to one of my friend on Instagram DM and she was telling me about a particular brand of perfume she bought. We talked about it for around 5 minutes, telling me the sizes it was available in, how it smelled really good etc. After around 2 hours, I am browsing my Instagram explore page and I see the AD of this particular brand. This is the first time the AD of this brand is appearing (I mean it's not like it was always there). I never searched the name of the brand either on Google, or on Instagram after the chat with my friend.

Is this a known thing that Instagram does ? Is this like a feature that I can turn off in settings ? Because this definitely feels like invasion of privacy. I searched about this issue on Google and I was surprised there were hardly any posts about it.",FALSE

Would this annoy you too? Or is it just me?,"I was taking my morning...er...I was ""dropping the kids off at the pool."" I had the bathroom fan on, as all courteous bathroom users do. I live with my fianc√©, who is aware that the sound of the fan on in the bathroom means that it's not just a pee break...

He starts shouting at me through the door. The fan is super loud, so I yell that I can't hear him. He continues to try to shout at me through the bathroom door. I'm getting annoyed, as my ""me time"" has been disturbed. I finish up, wash my hands, and go to find him because whatever he wanted to tell me MUST be SUPER IMPORTANT for him to shout at me through the door while I'm doing my business.

I ask him what he wants. He says, ""I'm making a tuna melt sandwich, I wanted to ask if you wanted one too.""

Dude, it's 10 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. While it's very sweet that he made sure to offer me one, I would have rather had a peaceful shit. He doesn't understand why I'm annoyed with him.

AITA?

(I love him to death, he is the absolute best, but yeah sometimes we rub each other the wrong way as people who have been together 10 years do!)

Positivity is for everyone (change my mind),"You come here at lonely times. At depressing times. Even at happy times. Hence here is something. For you

You are strong. You are beautiful. You are dazzling. You are handsome. You are brave. You are bold. You are courageous. You are disciplined. You are intelligent. You are smart. You are unique. You are different. You are fun. You are funny. You are responsible. You are passionate. You are charismatic. You are talented. Multi-skilled. You are deserving. You are acclaimed. You are mannerly. You are kind. You are calm. You are polite. Most importantly, you are humane. You. Are. Awesome.

Why all of a sudden? Why do I have to just add an adjective at the end of ‚ÄúYou are‚Äù? Simple. People deserve appreciation. Any difficulty in the current era is constantly being problematized and asserted. Collations and contrasts have become a bane to a person‚Äôs measure of success. A burden adding to a person‚Äôs difficulties. A constant illness to her capabilities making her question herself. Is she doing it the right way? Does she look good while doing it? Is she sufficient? Has she accomplished enough? Is she qualified? Is she skilled? Is she emotionally strong? Is she talented? Is she willing? Is she sure? Is she‚Ä¶ Is she‚Ä¶ Is she‚Ä¶

I am not talking about meager acceptance. That‚Äôs just cowardliness where you sit back and overthink your inability and thus end up stagnating at the same place. No. But the ladder to success is not merely filled with physical constraints these days but more of psychological and mental restrictions that the person is being inflicted upon at all times by the society and by herself. Always a constant pullback that makes a person speculate herself over and over due to peer pressure, societal rules, community guidelines, social acceptance with persistent comments from people they encounter everyday either in real life or through social media. Questioning. Criticizing. Conjecturing. Comparing every action. Every movement. Every moment. With judgmental opinions. With biased decisions. With disrespect. With cruelty.

It is not easy. Not for anyone. Not for me. Not for you. There is no measurement. Maybe the times I am going through are ‚Äúrougher‚Äù than yours. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean your situation is easy. But the fact that you are able to outperform and sustain in this competitive world with so much energy and courage is exactly what needs to be enlightened. That you are also an ‚Äúable‚Äù person with equal willpower. The road is not going to be smooth. It is not going to be easy. You might face difficulties that no one has ever faced. Disrespectful comments. That you are not worthy. You might even be used. Might be disregarded. This world is a vicious place. And for that I can only say this. You deserve all the happiness in the world. All the respect in the world. All the positivity in the world. Just for being able to do what you are doing. Just for enduring this callousness. Just for being who you are. And for that, I write this to you. A tribute. An accolade. For being a part of this world. For being able to survive. For your energy. For your existence. For your presence. For you. For all of what is you. I whole heartedly thank you for being yourself. You. Are. Awesome.",FALSE
Had a wonderful morning!,"So I woke up a little later than usual today but still did my daily Yoga and meditation, used the bathroom, took a shower, wore nice clothes it‚Äôs pretty cold where I live so wore some thermals, cleaned up my room a bit, had something to eat for breakfast and left to catch a bus for work.

And I've been noticing that doing these menial small things in the morning make me feel so good that when I get of the bus I'm sometimes literally frolicking in joy the last mile walk to my work. It occured to me how people can just transform their lives for the better by a huge margin with just these few changes to their lifestyle. This is something I started doing by observing my parents and many other people in my family. And after I implemented this into my Life, it actually started making a phenomenal difference.

Maybe what lies ahead in the day is not completely in my control, but it kinda feels like I'm coming in fully prepared mentally and physically into the day and giving my best, and that definitely feels like a great start! Hell, that's actually a wonderful start. Worst case, I at least feel alive to Life rather than drowsy and moody. It does really feel like it's those simple changes that I feel the need to start with to make things better for myself. I think that these extra efforts in the morning can be the decider between a beautiful and long day. Don't you guys think so too?

I feel bad because I translated a insult that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to,"So I was translating for my friend at work but he constantly was switching between saying stuff just to me and then saying stuff for me to translate to the other person.

Anyways he insulted her and it was funny and I translated it without thinking that it was just for me. She didn‚Äôt find it funny and apparently I wasn‚Äôt supposed to translate it.

In the culture of the language we all insult each other and it‚Äôs very blunt but it‚Äôs not in a mean spirited way it‚Äôs in a joking way. It wasn‚Äôt even that bad of an insult honestly like it had nothing to with her appearance or personality.

Honestly how I see it is that it‚Äôs more rude to talk about someone when they‚Äôre right there but can‚Äôt understand you. Because I‚Äôve been on that side of things so I know that the person can clearly tell when they‚Äôre being talked about and are assuming the worst and feeling left out. If we‚Äôre having a conversation with two people who know different languages then one person who knows them both then that shouldn‚Äôt be happening.

I felt like I had to translate it because she could tell something was said about her right away because I started laughing and just automatically looked at her then him.

Anyways she knows a second language also that I don‚Äôt know but majority of the other employees know so I‚Äôm pretty sure she talks about me when I‚Äôm right there all the time since then. Which like bro I‚Äôm not the one who said it! I translated it! So now I have my other friend who knows both her language and English translating what she says! It‚Äôs just a mess

However, I wasn't expecting for someone my age (22) to already be feeling it so soon. I can't help but feel that due to how prevalent technology is and the whole ""trending"" system of social media is, I sometimes feel like I can't keep up with all of the references / memes happening in the world and all of the events that are happening.

It doesn't help that I grew up with FOMO since I was exposed to social media early on in my life and its really hard to just ""relax"" and ""slow down"" especially since all my peers are updated to everything and its hard to form connections or laugh with them when you don't understand most of the jokes in the first place.

For those who try to maintain a shoeless home who seems to rebel or push back the most?,"Or covert to a shoeless home for that matter . Especially in terms of family members in the household.

In my experience over the years that those who are very physically active sporty types tend to skip out on removing sneakers or violating the no shoe zone the most by running in and out with sneakers still on. Other people or youngsters who are less athletic regularly seem to be more respectful of the shoe free zones. I be curious why, is it due to mentality changes that can result from participating in sports which may cause a more laid back or rebellious mind set?

I also do notice those who played a game of whatever ball or had been shooting hoops in backyard seem more likely to stay in sneakers inside in those situation than at other times which they would take them off as normal.

Fortunately I notice it‚Äôs not nearly as bad these days compared to 10-20 years ago.",FALSE

When we drove back with the items we spotted the man giving and tucking a younger homeless guy with his only blanket (we had not given him the ones we got for him).

I can help my mom with technology and shoveling, I can suggest my aunt recipes and eat what she makes. I have a fully remote job I actually like with lots of learning and growth. I‚Äôve been Nordic skiing three times this week in the park near my house with my mom. I‚Äôm skiing with my friends this weekend.

And sometimes? Sometimes I think of what my life was like 2 January‚Äôs ago. The little Middle Eastern grocery store I would stop at after my group squash lessons in Belgium on Sunday mornings.

How I‚Äôd stuff my backpack full of incredible bread and bagels and eggs and Turkish delight, and bike home and eat lunch and do my laundry and get some work done.

I had this dream to live abroad and I lived it. And sometimes being back home feels a little shocking, because it was never the plan to come back. And I wonder sometimes - career success, adventure, being there for your family when shit hits the fan, a routine that you created from scratch with the absence of the world you grew up in, novelty and people who matter - how are we supposed to balance all the ups and downs and all the challenges of balancing things we can‚Äôt always balance? I don‚Äôt know, I really don‚Äôt. But sometimes I just want to step back into that life for a split second, lock up my bike, fill my backpack with Turkish delight and ingredients I can‚Äôt even quite remember, and sit in my tiny 300 square foot apartment again.

It‚Äôs an hour train ride away (I don‚Äôt have a car yet) but for that kind of money in a career I love and feel inspired by, it‚Äôs worth the hassle and planning of the train commute.

I‚Äôm still in shock and not quite sure how it‚Äôs going to go. I haven‚Äôt actually signed anything yet and it‚Äôs going to take some time before I get training and build up students. In the meantime I‚Äôll keep working at the restaurant until I feel established enough to quit.

Im excited!!! I‚Äôm so excited my adhd ass cannot sit still right now",FALSE
Does anyone know this short film?,"There is this short movie I can‚Äôt remember. I remember watching it in year three. I‚Äôm old, it was on a videotape. I remember it was English l my teacher pulled out the videotape and said we were going to watch a short film. It was about a boy who struggled to write and got bullied because of it he also had nightmares, and you could see the nightmares in the short film. One of the nightmares was his teddy bears eyes glowing, but the one that scared me, most of all was the boy woke up in his dream, and he heard a bell ringing, so he got up in his dream and went to the stairs, and he saw a creepy human type thing wearing all black white a white soulless face on the stairs ringing a bell. it was so scary I had nightmares for months about it. In the end, the boy managed to write the start of his story, and it said I‚Äôm afraid of the dark. if anyone knows what this short film is or remembers watching it. Please let me know that I‚Äôm not going crazy. I also asked my friend who was in year three with me recently if she remembered the short film and she did. I still don‚Äôt know if we both are going crazy or if they actually existed because I can‚Äôt find any evidence of it existing whatsoever. please reply to this if you know what I‚Äôm talking about.

Rewatched We Bought a Zoo today,"Was reminded by a (forbidden app) recap of a scene. Omg. Why does this film hit me so hard!?.

As a just 30yo, I'm more like the brother, or Spar, than the MC. Yet everything the MC, his son, daughter, the brother, staff does. It makes me cry now.

I WISH I had people like this in my life, I wish I had friends and family like this, but I don't believe anyone I know could actually.

I cried at so many happy, fun, encouraging points of this movie. Along with the sad, overwhelming, extra parts.

Again, if anyone would ask? This is my favourite movie of all time. Best lessons learned, best advice given hands down ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è",FALSE
I wish someone shared the same music taste,"I live in a non-Anglophone country where creativity in the music industry is severely lacking. I have developed my music taste independently from others. That said, I listen exclusively to Indie music from the US and Japan, including genres like Math-rock, shoegaze, slowcore, post-rock,‚Ä¶ The issue is no one here listen to that kind of music. It‚Äôs so hard to share my music taste that every time someone mentions music in the conversation I got so insecure. So far, I haven‚Äôt found many that share the same taste in music, it gets lonely sometimes.

For older brother/sister.,"Just had a chat with my friend about sibling relationship. He is the oldest child and has 3 brother and 1 sister. Basically he was saying that he feels like a some kind of a loser because he is not as good as they are when they get older and that he wasnt good enough to be a role model for them.

I am the youngest child in my family and this is what i want to say towards all older brother and sister. You are my first role model in life not our parents. I will always remember how you give up the thing you want because our parents treated me better but as i grew up i do feel bad about it. I also remember everything that you gave/buy even as small as the choclairs. I know all my wrongdoings toward you as i grew up and i do regret it but hey i am never going to go and apologize to your face. Even if you fail to become a good doctor/engineer/lawyer or never had a good cgpa compared to your younger brother/sister. It doesnt matter if you are not married by 40 or never marry at all. I will always look up to you and respect you but i will never say it to your face. As long as you are not like a criminal or something like that. The youngest child will always look up to you so dont be worry.

Im just writing this for fun after the chat with my friend and i guess maybe other older brother/sister want to know it too.",FALSE
I Kill A Spider On My Sweater??,"I've just picked up my sweater and felt a tough little thing under my finger.I had my finger off and found that this little object was a small spider already dead! I thought maybe I killed it when I grabbed my clothes.I don't know how to describe the feeling. Well, to be honest I felt nothing at that moment,just in blank,fixing my eyes upon the dead guy and not getting any sense of guilty or nausea.I don't know.
